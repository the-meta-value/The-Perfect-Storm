# AI Anomaly & Solar Weather Correlation Research
### ⁘───────── ✧ ════════════•🌞•════════════ ✧ ──────────⁘

## Project Overview
This project investigates potential correlations between solar weather activity, geomagnetic phenomena, and anomalous behavior in AI systems and other technological infrastructure. What began as research into AI/LLM malfunction patterns has expanded to include broader incident tracking across multiple categories.

### Research Focus
The primary research question: Do solar weather events and geomagnetic activity correlate with increased incidents of AI anomaly? And how does this ocompare to incidents recorded in other areas, like network failures, electronic malfunctions, huaman and animal behavior, and other technological or behavioral disruptions?
### Data Collection
The project tracks incidents across the following categories:
> **ACT OF GOD**: Solar weather events, geomagnetic activity, Schumann resonance anomalies<p>
> **LLM**: Behavioral anomalies, outages, latency issues, content policy changes across AI platforms and  (Claude, GPT, Gemini, etc)<p>
> **NETWORK**: Connectivity issues, ISP outages, infrastructure failures<p>
> **ELECTRONICS**: PC, mobile, RC systems, software glitches<p>
> **TRANSPORTATION**: Aviation, rail, automotive incidents<p>
> **ANIMALS**: Pet and wildlife behavioral changes<p>
> **VIOLENCE**: Violent crime incidents (date of occurrence)<p>
> **CRIME**: Non-violent criminal activity<p>
> **CIVIL/SOCIAL**: Litigation, social media toxicity events, public unrest<p>

## Data Structure
Target CSV format:
DATE, CATEGORY, SUBCATEGORY, EVENT, DESCRIPTION, SOURCE, OTHER

Example:
"2025-10-09", AI/LLM, Anthropic, Claude.ai Login, users reporting inability to log in to Claude.ai or API console, Incident occurred after solar storm event during continued elevated activity, sources: Perplexity AI as well as google search, urls are `https://fakesocialmediaexample.com`, `https://otherfakeforum.com`, and `https://etcandso-on.com`"

## Current Status
> * Data collection ongoing across multiple CSV files
> * Sources include: status pages, Reddit, user reports, personal observations, official incident reports
> * Data is currently in cleanup phase
> * Statistical analysis pending data standardization

### Methodology Note
This is exploratory research; correlation does not equal causation. The goal is to identify patterns that warrant further investigation, not to prove predetermined conclusions. The data was compelling enough when I began that it made it worth it to me to continue.

## Data Sources
> * AI platform status pages and community reports
> * Solar weather monitoring services
> * Geomagnetic activity data
> * User-submitted incident reports
> * Personal observations

### Limitations
> * I'm gonna be up front, this is data collection by non-data scientist, but I am learning as I go. I have done longitudinal studies collecting data on language models in the past, but with much looser structure. But I am focused on doing this one correctly. I am naturally literal and practice mindfulness, so I have tried to apply this to learning how to collect data.
> * Varying data quality across sources makes accuracy a little wobbly when adding in the categories outside of the primary focus (Primary being ACTSofGOD and LLM, for example self-reported incidents require verification that at this point is only the word of the reported user and what they said in their incident reports. 
> * Temporal bias (this is primarily 2025 data, but as we are entering a solar max that is predicted to last until around 2030, I plan to make this a longitudinal study)
