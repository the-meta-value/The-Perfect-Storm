Date Range,Geomagnetic Activity (Kp Index / NOAA Scale),Solar Activity (Flares),Notes
Sept 19 – Sept 26,"Mostly Quiet to Unsettled (Kp 1-4). Brief G1 (Minor) storms observed on Sept 17, but the immediate following days were low.","Mostly Low to Moderate. Multiple M-class flares occurred on the 19th (M1.5), 23rd (M1.0), and 24th (M1.0, M1.6), and C-class flares were frequent.","This period saw active regions rotating into view, leading to an increase in flare activity."
Sept 27 – Sept 28,Mostly Quiet to Unsettled (Kp 1-3).,"Moderate to High. An M6.4 flare occurred on the 28th, but no Earth-directed Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) were initially observed from it.",Solar wind sped up slightly due to a small coronal hole.
Sept 29 – Sept 30,Ramped up to G3 (Strong) Storm levels.,"High/Moderate. Multiple M-class flares (M3.6, M1.0, M1.1, M1.1, M1.1, M1.8) occurred.","A surprise G3 (Strong) storm occurred on Sept 29-30, driven by a sustained, fast solar wind stream and southward magnetic fields (Bz), which couples efficiently with Earth's magnetosphere."
October 1,"Continued at Active to G2 (Moderate) Storm levels, with periods of strong activity.",Moderate. M1.8 and M1.2 flares were observed.,"The geomagnetic storming continued, making for a long-duration event."
