## Tracking Anonolous Behavior, breakdowns, and system failures of LLMs and their correlation to Solar Weather as a timeline

sorry about the messy data

# Project Overview
#### This project investigates potential correlations between solar weather activity, geomagnetic phenomena, and anomalous behavior in AI systems and other technological infrastructure. What began as research into AI/LLM malfunction patterns has expanded to include broader incident tracking for comparison (networks, large social platforms, ISPs, clouds, that sort of thing)

### Research Focus
The primary research question: Do solar weather events and geomagnetic activity correlate with increased incidents of AI error and anomaly? And how does this ocompare to incidents recorded in other areas, like network failures and other technological disruptions?

#### Data Collection
The project tracks incidents across the following categories:

ACT OF GOD: Solar weather events, geomagnetic activity, solar storms, flares, solar weather events

LLM: Behavioral anomalies, outages, latency issues, content policy changes across AI platforms and (Claude, GPT, Gemini, etc), behavioral anomalies

NETWORK: Connectivity issues, ISP outages, infrastructure failures, social media platforms

#### Data Sources  
- AI platform status pages and community reports  
- Solar weather monitoring services
- Geomagnetic activity data

Limitations  
Temporal bias (this is primarily 2025 data, but as we are entering a solar maxima that is predicted to last until around 2030, I plan to make this a longitudinal study)
