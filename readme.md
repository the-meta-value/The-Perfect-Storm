sorry about the messy data

# Project Overview
## This project investigates 
potential correlations between solar weather activity, geomagnetic phenomena, and anomalous behavior in AI systems and other technological infrastructure. What began as research into AI/LLM malfunction patterns has expanded to include broader incident tracking across multiple categories.

Research Focus
The primary research question: Do solar weather events and geomagnetic activity correlate with increased incidents of AI anomaly? And how does this ocompare to incidents recorded in other areas, like network failures, electronic malfunctions, huaman and animal behavior, and other technological or behavioral disruptions?

Data Collection
The project tracks incidents across the following categories:

ACT OF GOD: Solar weather events, geomagnetic activity, Schumann resonance anomalies

LLM: Behavioral anomalies, outages, latency issues, content policy changes across AI platforms and (Claude, GPT, Gemini, etc)

NETWORK: Connectivity issues, ISP outages, infrastructure failures

ELECTRONICS: PC, mobile, RC systems, software glitches

TRANSPORTATION: Aviation, rail, automotive incidents

ANIMALS: Pet and wildlife behavioral changes

VIOLENCE: Violent crime incidents (date of occurrence)

CRIME: Non-violent criminal activity

CIVIL/SOCIAL: Litigation, social media toxicity events, public unrest

Current Status
Data collection ongoing across multiple CSV files
Sources include: status pages, Reddit, user reports, personal observations, official incident reports
Data is currently in cleanup phase
Statistical analysis pending data standardization
Methodology Note
This is exploratory research; correlation does not equal causation. The goal is to identify patterns that warrant further investigation, not to prove predetermined conclusions. The data was compelling enough when I began that it made it worth it to me to continue.

Data Sources
AI platform status pages and community reports
Solar weather monitoring services
Geomagnetic activity data
User-submitted incident reports
Personal observations
Limitations
I'm gonna be up front, this is data collection by a non-data scientist; I generally don't work with large sets of data like this, so the organizational understanding leaves something to be desired. I have done longitudinal studies collecting data on language models in the past, but with much looser structure. But I am focused on doing this one correctly. I am naturally literal and practice mindfulness, so I have tried to apply this to learning how to collect data.
Varying data quality across sources makes accuracy a little wobbly when adding in the categories outside of the primary focus (Primary being ACTSofGOD and LLM, for example self-reported incidents require verification that at this point is only the word of the reported user and what they said in their incident reports.
Temporal bias (this is primarily 2025 data, but as we are entering a solar max that is predicted to last until around 2030, I plan to make this a longitudinal study)
