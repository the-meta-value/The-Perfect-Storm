Activity Type,Status & Scale,Key Details
Geomagnetic,"Active to G2 (Moderate) Storm likely, with a chance of an isolated G3 (Strong) Storm.","Activity is high and dynamic due to high-speed solar wind (speeds of 700-800+ km/s). 
 Kp index has been fluctuating, with peaks observed at Kp 7 (G3 - Strong Storm) in the past 24 hours."
Solar Flare,Moderate levels.,"The strongest flares in the past 24 hours were two M1.2-class flares (Minor R1 Radio Blackouts). 
 Forecasters predict a high chance (60%) for M-class flares and a slight chance (15%) for X-class flares (the strongest category)."
Sunspots,High/Complex.,"Multiple large and complex active regions are visible (e.g., AR4230, AR4232, AR4236), some of which have the complex 'beta-gamma-delta' magnetic configuration that harbors energy for major flares."
Aurora,High Chance.,"Auroras are highly likely at high latitudes (Canada, Alaska, etc.) and may be visible at mid-latitudes (e.g., northern US states) if G2/G3 conditions persist."
